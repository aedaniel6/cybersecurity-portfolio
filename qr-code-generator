# QR Code Generator in Python
# Project Description
_2025_07_25

I developed a Python-based QR code generator as my first Python project, demonstrating foundational programming skills and an understanding of digital verification tools—a core component of modern cybersecurity workflows. 
This utility creates QR codes for various types of data (URLs, text, contact information), showcasing how simple code can enable secure, fast, and versatile information sharing.

**Features**

PROJECT SETUP:

1. Created a Python environment and project structure from scratch.

2. Library Integration: Utilized essential Python libraries (e.g., qrcode, Pillow) for QR code generation and image handling.

3. Custom Functions: Implemented functions to programmatically generate and save QR codes in multiple formats.

4. User Interface: Designed a simple, user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.

5. Educational Value: Explored the applications of QR codes in digital verification, marketing, product tracking, and event management—all relevant to cybersecurity use cases like secure access and asset tracking.

**Applications in Cybersecurity**

QR codes are widely used for secure information sharing, authentication, and digital asset tracking—making them relevant for anyone interested in cybersecurity, digital verification, and 
secure communication methods. This project demonstrates practical Python skills and an understanding of how digital tools can enhance security workflows.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

1. Python Programming

2. Library Management

3. Functional Coding

4. User Interface Design

**Understanding of Digital Verification Methods**

CODE EXAMPLE:

import qrcode

def generate_qr(data, filename="qrcode.png"):
    img = qrcode.make(data)
    img.save(filename)
    print(f"QR code saved as {filename}")

# Example usage
generate_qr("https://github.com/yourusername/qr-generator")
