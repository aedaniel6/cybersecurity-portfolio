# About Me

**Name:** Ayana Daniel

**Hometown:** Ellenwood, Georgia

**Prior IT Experience:** Novice cyber student and enthusiast. Currently studying Azure with an interest in Cloud Computing. I love the distinctive and ever changing landscape cybersecurity presents. As the world grows and becomes more interconnected, cybersecurity related threats and attacks have increased and exploited many sectors. With cybersecurity, their is always opportunity to skill build as unique challenges will constantly arise.

**Career Plans:** Upon completion of this program I would like to seek a role as a cyber analyst leaning into threat intelligence. I am interested in working in the governmental or manufacturing industry as I believe both of these sectors will be even more heavily impacted by cyber attacks in the future. My short term aspiration would be to obtain a role as a cloud support intern.

**Proud Task/Project:** A task I am proud of is passing my first exam and receiving my first certificate in Cloud Fundamentals. This was the first test related to computing and cybersecurity and while I was taking my first college course concurrently, this was my first certificate earned. It allowed me to demonstrate to myself and the world that I was capable of understanding the material and its application via labs.**
